# Pressure Sampling Optimization

## Overview
This document outlines the optimization of pressure sampling to achieve maximum sampling rate for the EOL Leak Tester. The pressure transducer (PT) has a response time of 0.001 sec (1000 Hz), and the ADC can sample up to 860 SPS, making the ADC the limiting factor.

## Hardware Specifications
- **Pressure Transducer**: Response time 0.001 sec (1000 Hz capability)
- **ADC (ADS1115)**: Maximum sampling rate 860 SPS
- **I2C Bus**: 400 kHz fast mode
- **Limiting Factor**: ADC at 860 SPS

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Configuration Optimizations
```yaml
# High-speed ADC configuration
pressure_transducer:
  adc:
    sample_rate: 860               # Maximum ADC rate
    high_speed_mode: true          # Enable high-speed operation
    single_shot_mode: false        # Continuous sampling
    i2c_frequency: 400000          # 400kHz fast mode

# System performance optimization  
system:
  pressure_reading_samples: 1      # Single sample for max speed
  pressure_reading_delay: 0.001    # Minimal delay (1ms)
  enable_burst_sampling: true      # Enable burst mode
  burst_sample_count: 10           # Optimized burst size
  burst_sample_rate: 860           # Max ADC rate
  continuous_sampling: true        # No delays between samples

# UI optimization for smooth display
ui:
  update_rates:
    pressure_update_hz: 50         # 50 Hz UI updates
    ui_refresh_ms: 20              # 20ms refresh (50 Hz)
```

### 2. ADC Reader Enhancements

- **High-Speed Mode**: Optimized for maximum throughput
- **Continuous Mode**: Eliminates single-shot conversion overhead
- **Burst Sampling**: Precise timing for high-speed data collection
- **Fast Read Method**: Single sample with minimal latency

### 3. Pressure Calibration Optimizations
- **Smart Sampling**: Automatic selection of optimal sampling method
- **Burst Mode Integration**: Uses burst sampling for small sample counts
- **Configuration-Driven**: Automatically applies system configuration
- **Minimal Latency**: Single fast reads when only one sample needed

### 4. UI Performance Improvements
- **50 Hz Updates**: Smooth plot updates instead of 4 Hz
- **20ms Refresh**: Real-time responsive interface
- **Optimized Pressure Reading**: Uses configuration-optimized sampling

## Performance Comparison

### Before Optimization:
- **Sampling Rate**: ~20 Hz effective (4 Hz UI × 3 samples + delays)
- **Latency**: ~150ms (3 samples × 50ms delay)
- **UI Updates**: 4 Hz (250ms intervals)
- **Sample Method**: Multiple samples with 50ms delays

### After Optimization:
- **Sampling Rate**: Up to 860 Hz (ADC maximum)
- **Latency**: ~1.2ms (1 sample + minimal processing)
- **UI Updates**: 50 Hz (20ms intervals)
- **Sample Method**: Single fast reads or optimized burst sampling

## Implementation Details

### ADC Configuration
The ADS1115 is configured for maximum performance:
- **Data Rate**: 860 SPS (0x07 register value)
- **Gain**: 2 (±2.048V range for 4-20mA module)
- **Mode**: Continuous conversion
- **I2C**: 400 kHz fast mode

### Sampling Strategies
1. **Single Sample** (num_samples=1): Uses `read_current_fast()` for minimal latency
2. **Burst Sampling** (≤10 samples): Uses `read_burst_samples()` with precise timing
3. **Multi-Sample** (>10 samples): Falls back to traditional method with reduced delays

### Timing Analysis
- **PT Response**: 1ms (can handle 1000 Hz)
- **ADC Conversion**: 1.16ms (860 SPS)
- **I2C Transfer**: ~0.1ms (400 kHz)
- **Processing**: <0.1ms
- **Total Latency**: ~1.3ms per sample
